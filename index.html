                <p>I was born on a pirate ship, with apples all around me. No one ever told me who my parents were. I was raised on apple butter, apple pie, apple crisp, apple cobbler, apple juice, and apples. I always wondered why the pirates didn't raid other ships of a different fruit.</p>

                <p>When I finally found land at the age of 19, my first friend was a dog named Pubcrawl. Pubcrawl and I often spent weeks apart, but we'd always reunite on the 15th of each month to swap stories and share some sausages she stealthily <span>stole</span> acquired at the Monday market.</p>

            <div class="div-3">
                <p>After 12 years of this lifestyle, Pubcrawl and I parted ways. She was going back to sea for another many moons, she said. I vowed to never spend another night on open waters, so we had to say goodbye. Hope to see you soon, Pubcrawl...</p>
